The goal of this project (for The Odin Project curriculum) was to create a functioning basic calculator. Time got away from me for a bit longer than I expected, so I had to rely on a tutorial for understanding the logic. Luckily, it helped me learn more about the capabilities of ES6 and JS classes.
